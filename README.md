# README

The purpose of this project was to play around with React inside a Rails project using Vite.

I am using Ruby 3.2 and Rails 7.0

The Backend of this project is a Rails API which provides the content to the views.

The Frontend used is ReactJS using [Vite Ruby](https://vite-ruby.netlify.app/guide/rails.html)

I added [Antd Design](https://ant.design/) to beautify a bit the UI.

It is a very simple project with the only aim to setup a project with Ruby on Rails + React + Vite, which I think it is a great combination.
